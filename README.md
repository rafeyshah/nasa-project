# NASA Project

## Overview

This project was developed as a part of learning Node.js and Express.js, with a focus on various functionalities. The project involves implementing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database using Mongoose, parsing CSV files with the `csv-parse` library, writing test cases using Supertest and Jest, and exploring concepts related to performance improvement through Cluster's Load Balancing using the Process Manager 2 library and Worker Threads using `worker_threads`. The frontend of the project is adapted from the NASA Launch Mission React Template.

## Functionalities

### 1. CRUD Operations with Mongoose MongoDB

Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a MongoDB database using Mongoose, providing a solid foundation for managing data.

### 2. CSV File Parsing and Database Storage

Utilized the `csv-parse` library to parse CSV files, read data from them, and store it into the MongoDB database. This functionality enhances data handling capabilities within the application.

### 3. Test Cases with Supertest and Jest

Developed comprehensive test cases using Supertest and Jest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionalities. This practice contributes to the overall robustness of the application.

### 4. Performance Improvement Techniques

Explored and implemented performance improvement techniques, including Cluster's Load Balancing using the Process Manager 2 library and Worker Threads using `worker_threads`. These additions enhance the scalability and efficiency of the application.

### 5. Frontend Adaptation from NASA Launch Mission React Template

Integrated the frontend of the project using the NASA Launch Mission React Template, providing an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
